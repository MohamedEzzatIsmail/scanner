Overview
This OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline extracts text from images using image preprocessing, text detection, and character recognition techniques. The pipeline is designed to be modular, allowing you to integrate and customize each component as needed.

Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the OCR pipeline:

cv2 (OpenCV): For image processing and thresholding.
tensorflow (optional): For character recognition using deep learning models.
numpy: For numerical operations.

Functions
preprocess_image(image_path)
Description:
Preprocesses the input image to improve the quality for text extraction. The preprocessing includes converting the image to grayscale, applying binary thresholding, and optionally removing noise.

Parameters:

image_path (str): Path to the input image file.
Returns:

cleaned (numpy.ndarray): Preprocessed binary image.

detect_text_regions(image)
Description:
Detects regions in the image that likely contain text by finding contours in the binary image.

Parameters:

image (numpy.ndarray): Binary image from the preprocessing step.
Returns:

text_regions (list of tuples): List of bounding boxes, each represented as a tuple (x, y, w, h).

recognize_text(region_image, model)
Description:
Recognizes text from a given image region using a pre-trained character recognition model.

Parameters:

region_image (numpy.ndarray): Image of the text region to recognize.
model (tensorflow.keras.Model): Pre-trained character recognition model.
Returns:

predicted_class (int): Predicted class of the text (e.g., character).

ocr_pipeline(image_path, model)
Description:
Combines preprocessing, text detection, and text recognition into a complete OCR pipeline.

Parameters:

image_path (str): Path to the input image file.
model (tensorflow.keras.Model): Pre-trained character recognition model.
Returns:

extracted_text (list of str): List of recognized text from the image regions.

Notes
Model Training: The recognize_text function assumes you have a pre-trained model. You should train a model using a dataset of text images and labels. The model architecture can be a CNN or any other suitable architecture for text recognition.
Image Preprocessing: The preprocessing steps can be adjusted based on the quality and characteristics of the images you are working with.
Text Detection: Simple contour-based text detection may not be suitable for all types of images. For complex cases, consider using advanced text detection algorithms.
